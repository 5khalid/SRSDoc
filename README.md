<h1>KFUPMTutoring project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project involves developing a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a mobile application called KFUPMTutoring. The app is designed to connect KFUPM students who need tutoring services with fellow students who can provide those services. The app will allow users to create accounts, search for available tutors, book tutorials, pay in advance, rate the tutorial received, and report any misconduct from the tutors.
